**Note: There is now a Google backed open source JDBC driver for Google Cloud Spanner.**
It is recommended that you use that driver. It can be found here: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java/tree/master/google-cloud-clients/google-cloud-contrib/google-cloud-spanner-jdbc

This community driver will continue to exist in its current form. It will however not implement any new features that Cloud Spanner might add in the future.

Community Open Source JDBC Driver for Google Cloud Spanner

An open source JDBC Driver for Google Cloud Spanner, the horizontally scalable, globally consistent, relational database service from Google. The JDBC Driver that is supplied by Google is quite limited, as it does not allow any inserts, updates or deletes, nor does it allow DDL-statements.

This driver supports a number of unsupported features of the official JDBC driver:
* DML-statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
* DDL-statements (CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS], ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS], DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS], ...)
* Transactions (both read/write and read-only)
* Support for JPA/Hibernate and several other popular Java frameworks, such as Spring Boot, Apache Beam, Flyway, Apache Spark and many more.

The driver ofcourse also supports normal SELECT-statements, including parameters. Example usage and tutorials can be found on http://www.googlecloudspanner.com/.

Releases are available on Maven Central and here: https://github.com/olavloite/spanner-jdbc/releases. Current release is version 1.1.5.

Include the following if you want the thick jar version that includes all (shaded) dependencies. This is the recommended version unless you know that the transitive dependencies of the small jar will not conflict with the rest of your project.

<div class="highlight highlight-text-xml"><pre>
&lt;<span class="pl-ent">dependency</span>&gt;
 	&lt;<span class="pl-ent">groupId</span>&gt;nl.topicus&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">groupId</span>&gt;
    	&lt;<span class="pl-ent">artifactId</span>&gt;spanner-jdbc&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">artifactId</span>&gt;
    	&lt;<span class="pl-ent">version</span>&gt;1.1.5&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">version</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">dependency</span>&gt;
</pre></div>

You can also use the driver with third-party tools such as SQuirreL, SQL Workbench, DbVisualizer, DBeaver or Safe FME. Have a look at this site for more information on how to use the driver with different tools and frameworks: http://www.googlecloudspanner.com/

Downloads for both the current and older versions can be found here: https://github.com/olavloite/spanner-jdbc/releases

Building your own version can be done using:

`mvn install -DskipITs`

(See the section [Building](#building) for more information on this)

## Data Manipulation Language (Insert/Update/Delete)
This driver does allow DML operations, but with some limitations because of the underlying limitations of Google Cloud Spanner. Google Cloud Spanner essentially limits all data manipulation to operations that operate on one record. This driver circumvents that by translating statements operating on multiple rows into SELECT-statements that fetch the records to be updated, and then updates each row at a time in one transaction. Data manipulation operations that operate on one row at a time are recognized by the driver and sent directly to the database. This means that normal data manipulation generated by frameworks like Hibernate are executed without any additional delays.

Please note that the underlying limitations of Google Cloud Spanner transactions still apply: https://cloud.google.com/spanner/quotas. This means a maximum of 20,000 mutations and 100MB of data in one transaction. You can get the driver to automatically bypass these quotas by setting the connection property AllowExtendedMode=true (see the Wiki-pages of this driver: https://github.com/olavloite/spanner-jdbc/wiki/URL-and-Connection-Properties).

Example of bulk INSERT:  
```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE1  
(COL1, COL2, COL3)  
SELECT SOMECOL1, SOMECOL2, SOMECOL3  
FROM TABLE2  
WHERE SOMECOL1>? AND SOMECOL3 LIKE ?  
```

Example of bulk INSERT-OR-UPDATE:  
```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE1  
(COL1, COL2, COL3)  
SELECT COL1, COL2+COL4, COL3*2  
FROM TABLE1  
WHERE COL4=?  
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE  
```

The above UPDATE example is equal to:
```sql
UPDATE TABLE1 SET COL2=COL2+COL4 AND COL3=COL3*2 WHERE COL4=?
```
(assuming that COL1 is the primary key of the table).

Example of bulk UPDATE:  
```sql
UPDATE TABLE1 SET  
COL1=COL1*1.1,  
COL2=COL3+COL4  
WHERE COL5<1000  
```

Have a look at this article for more DML examples: http://www.googlecloudspanner.com/2018/02/data-manipulation-language-with-google.html

## JPA and Hibernate
The driver is designed to work with applications using JPA/Hibernate. See https://github.com/olavloite/spanner-hibernate for a Hibernate Dialect implementation for Google Cloud Spanner that works together with this JDBC Driver.

A simple example project using Spring Boot + JPA + Hibernate + this JDBC Driver can be found here: https://github.com/olavloite/spanner-jpa-example

Example usage:

```java
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=nl.topicus.jdbc.CloudSpannerDriver

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:cloudspanner://localhost;Project=projectId;Instance=instanceId;Database=databaseName;SimulateProductName=PostgreSQL;PvtKeyPath=key_file;AllowExtendedMode=false
```

The last two properties (SimulateProductName and PvtKeyPath) are optional.
All properties can also be supplied in a Properties object instead of in the URL.

You either need to
* Create an environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS that points to a credentials file for a Google Cloud Spanner project.
* OR Supply the parameter PvtKeyPath that points to a file containing the credentials to use.

The server name (in the example above: localhost) is only used by the driver if you run against a Cloud Spanner emulator, but as it is a mandatory part of a JDBC URL it always needs to be specified.
The property 'SimulateProductName' indicates what database name should be returned by the method DatabaseMetaData.getDatabaseProductName(). This can be used in combination with for example Spring Batch. Spring Batch automatically generates a schema for batch jobs, parameters etc., but does so only if it recognizes the underlying database. Supplying PostgreSQL as a value for this parameter, ensures the correct schema generation.

## Distributed transactions
As of version 0.20 and newer the driver has support for distributed transactions (XADatasource and XAResource). Note that this is not a feature that is supported by Google Cloud Spanner, and that the driver needs to simulate support for two-phase commit by storing all prepared mutations in a custom table. Have a look here for a sample project: https://github.com/olavloite/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples/spring-boot-sample-jta-atomikos

## Spring Boot
The driver has been tested with a number of popular frameworks. Have a look at this page for a list of sample applications with Spring Boot and related frameworks: http://www.googlecloudspanner.com/2017/12/google-cloud-spanner-and-spring-boot.html

## Building
The driver is by default a 'thick' jar that contains all the dependencies it needs. The dependencies are shaded to avoid any conflicts with dependencies you might use in your own project. Shading and adding the dependencies to the jar is linked to the `post-integration-test` phase of Maven. This means that you could build both a thin and a thick jar to use with your project, but please be aware that only the thick jar version is supported. If you decide to use the thin jar you need to supply the dependencies yourself.

### Building a thick jar (default)

`mvn install -DskipITs`

Skipping the integration tests while building is necessary as these will try to connect to a default Cloud Spanner instance (or Cloud Spanner emulator) to run the tests on. The key file for authenticating on these default instances are not included in the source code. If you want to run the integration tests, you should set up an emulator as running the ITs on a real Cloud Spanner instance is very slow. See http://www.googlecloudspanner.com/2018/07/create-trial-account-for-cloud-spanner.html for how to setup an emulator.

### Building a thin jar (not recommended)

`mvn package`

This will give you a jar containing only the compiled source of the JDBC driver without the necessary dependencies. You will have to supply these yourself. This is not the recommended way of using the driver, unless you know what you are doing.
